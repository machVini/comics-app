# Marvel Comics Listing App

This is an app built to list comics from Marvel using the official Marvel API. The main goal of this project is to consolidate knowledge about mobile app development and to learn about the migration/transition of software architectures, specifically from the VPI (View-Presenter-Interactor) architecture to MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).

## Architecture

The initial project was developed using the VPI (View-Presenter-Interactor) architecture, a common approach for Android mobile app development. However, as part of the learning objective, we are gradually migrating to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which offers a clearer separation of concerns and facilitates code testability and maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- Kotlin: Primary programming language.
- Koin: Lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin.
- Android SDK: Framework for Android app development.
- Retrofit: Library for HTTP requests in Android.
- Flow: Kotlin's asynchronous data stream library, used for handling asynchronous operations.
